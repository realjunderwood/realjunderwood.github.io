<h2>Finding Codenames Clues using NLP</h2>
<p>I wrote a little Python script to generate clues for the game [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) using GLoVE vectors. The program looks for clues that are close to each of the "good" words (your side's words) but far from the "bad" words (the other side's words). </p>
