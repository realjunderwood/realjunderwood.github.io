<h2>About Conway's Game of Life</h2>
<p>Conway's "Game" of Life is a cellular automation 0-player-game determined only by its initial state.</p>
<h3>The Rules</h3>
<p>From Wikipedia:
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&oldid=829561294">
  <ol>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>The Technologies</h2>
<p>This program makes use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It uses the <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery library</a>. This is my first project to depend on jQuery, and I've found that it has simplified everything massively.</p>
