<p>On July 7, 2021, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/opinion/google-utility-antitrust-technology.html">published an op-ed</a><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> by Ohio attorney general Dave Yost titled “Let’s Make Google a Public Good”. In it, Yost explained the anti-trustesque lawsuit he filed against Google and advocated that the search engine be classified as a public utility, or a common carrier, which would impose new constraints on how the search engine could do business.</p>
<p>Reading Yost&#39;s essay, I was curious how it came to be. Who first reached out to whom — Yost or The Times? What editorial standards did The Times hold Yost to? How does a state attorney general’s office communicate with America’s newspaper of record and vice versa?</p>
<p>To find out, I filed a public records request asking for all communications between Yost’s office and The Times. Within a few weeks, a 129-page PDF landed in my inbox. The document — comprising a series of email exchanges between Yost staffers and Times editors — offers a unique inside look at how media and government operate and interact.</p>
<h2 id="first-contact">First Contact</h2>
<p>The op-ed was initiated not by Yost or his team, but by The Times. On June 23, Sid Mahanta, then a Times opinion editor, emailed Bethany McCorkle, Yost’s communications director, under the subject line “Hello, from NYT Opinion”:</p>

<span class="vhdl">Bethany,

I hope you<span class="hljs-symbol">'re</span> well! My name <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> Sid Mahanta, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> I oversee tech <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> business coverage <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the Times Opinion page.

I wondered <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> Attorney General Yost might be interested <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> penning an <span class="hljs-number">800</span>-word piece arguing <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> making Google a common carrier. I<span class="hljs-symbol">'d</span> love <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> hear how this would improve competition <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> be better <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> consumers, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> perhaps draw <span class="hljs-keyword">out</span> the railroad analogy that, as I understand it, Mr. Yost <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> using <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> help illustrate his <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> (great, historical metaphors are always an asset!)

<span class="hljs-keyword">If</span> anything, I think our readers will be fascinated <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> hear a <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> smart government regulation, argued by a prominent Republican official. As you no doubt know, we<span class="hljs-symbol">'re</span> seeing interesting legal challenges against Google from Texas, too; there<span class="hljs-symbol">'s</span> something very interesting happening among state AGs <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> tech, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> I<span class="hljs-symbol">'d</span> love <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> explore this a <span class="hljs-built_in">bit</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> you <span class="hljs-keyword">all</span> are game ...

Thanks so much,
Sid</span>
</code></pre><p>Mahanta’s reaching-out email is interesting in its own right. It’s long enough not to be ignored, and it’s personal, clear, and directed. Mahanta begins with a pleasantry (“I hope you’re well”), before introducing himself and his position. Then he states why he is writing. Throughout the email, he is professional while also casual-within-reason (“great, historical metaphors are always an asset!”, “if you all are game,” the use of ellipses).</p>

He states that the piece is looking at a “July 8/9” publication date and attaches a  contract for Yost’s office to fill out. That contract lays out The Times’s fact-checking policy. It makes it clear that The Times:</p>
<pre><code>will work <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> verify <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> facts <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> your Guest Essay, but <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> writer, you bear <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> ultimate responsibility <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> accuracy <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> your work.

</code></pre><p>We’ll hear more about fact-checking soon. For now, Mahanta and McCorkle and sending drafts back and forth with edits and revisions. A sampling of Mahanta’s comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>“My guess is no, but: Do you all have any data/ways to quantify how much more competitive the marketplace might get?”</li>
<li>“what, in a nutshell, happened?”</li>
<li>“Let’s please include some links in the next few paragraphs?”</li>
</ul>
<p>In the course of Mahanta and McCorkle exchanging manuscripts, the former informs the latter that he is now looking at a July 11 publication date. He follows that up with a new potential date, July 6th:</p>

</code></pre><p>Peterson attaches a file with 12 comments on various claims in the article. Peterson was fastidious, seemingly checking every source. When Yost’s folks wrote that Bing “claims a mere 5 percent of the U.S. market,” Peterson pointed out that the listed source gave that figure as 5.67% and thus that the figure would “round up to 6.”</p>
<p>In another spot, Yost makes reference to a bridge owned by the rail titan Cornelius Vanderbilt. Yost writes that Vanderbilt closed his bridge in 1866. Not even such a minor detail was overlooked by the Times fact-checker. Peterson writes in a comment that &quot;I think this actually happened in 1867 [not 1866] but I&#39;ve seen mixed reporting on it, so I hedged this&quot;: Peterson replaced the year with &quot;in the late 1860s.&quot; Suppose this had gone un-checked, and the final article kept the 1866 year. Would anybody have noticed?</p>
<p>At any rate, Yost’s folks have 12 sources to find. Maybe given the short timeframe, McCorkle brings in someone else from the office: Charles Miller, counsel to the AG. He sends McCorkle sourcing; she passes it along to Peterson.</p>
<p>At 2:02, <em>less than an hour</em> before The Times wants to publish the piece, Peterson asks McCorkle to clarify a source and proposes a change to the writing for McCorkle to approve: Yost’s op-ed describes the objection that Ohio is “using its law to attempt to control the [other states].” Peterson wants that to read “in a manner that burdens interstate commerce.”</p>

<p>Finally, the piece is published. Metadata I extracted from the article indicates that it went up at exactly 3:00. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210501000000*/https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion">The Internet Archive confirms</a> that it went live sometime between 2:46 and 4:09. The article garners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/opinion/google-utility-antitrust-technology.html#commentsContainer">298 reader comments on the Times website</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/opinion/google-utility-antitrust-technology.html#commentsContainer">is spread a good bit on Twitter</a>. Even foreign outlets and users — writing variously in <a href="https://twitter.com/comitedelectura/status/1420142506763751431">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarianneValen20/status/1413080754783916032">Afrikaans</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TFischerDGB/status/1414907453133705223">German</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mfouquenet/status/1413001164195614721">French</a>  — share the article. The next day, at 7:55 a.m., Yost himself tweets the essay:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google has become a public utility, with legal duties to operate without bias, like a railroad.<br><br>In this essay, I lay out the history and the argument in plain English (no legalese!) and explain Ohio’s lawsuit. <a href="https://t.co/KoVIW83ltd">https://t.co/KoVIW83ltd</a></p>&mdash; Attorney General Dave Yost (@DaveYostOH) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveYostOH/status/1413104555873742853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>(Interestingly, the Cleveland Plain Dealer <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2017/11/dave_yosts_casual_lighthearted.html">reported in 2017</a> that Yost “is only one with the password to his Twitter account.”)</p>
<p>Four days after being published online, on Sunday, July 11, the piece also makes it to the print edition of The Times.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing-">In Closing</h2>
<p>Reading these documents, I’m left with three closing thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Op-eds like this can be written on down-to-the-wire deadlines. The quick turn-around between revision is impressive. Edits were being made within hours the piece going online.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yost himself was barely involved in the nuts and bolts of writing the op-ed. The closest he gets to being mentioned is in an email McCorkle sends stating that “[h]e does prefer Dave vs David for what its [sic] worth.” Of course, Yost likely played a hand in writing the article, and he surely reviewed and approved it. If he himself isn’t the one corroborating this or that claim for the fact-checkers, I don’t think that’s a scandal. After all, isn’t that what a staff (in this case, a communications team) is for?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I can&#39;t help but wonder if there is a more efficient way to process the different drafts, edits, and revisions that the article went through. Rather than sending Microsoft Word files back and forth with names like Yost2a.docx, Yost3a.docx and 07yost.docx, could The Times have an interface for op-ed writers? Even a Google Doc would work better, I imagine. Of course, much of the world — from academia to art to business to, yes, the offices of state attorneys general — operates on emails and .docx files, and The Times wants to be as accessible as possible. It’s a tough balance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All the same, these documents, taken together, are, in a sense, inspiring. The fastidiousness of The Times folks is admirable. Likewise, Yost&#39;s people are competent, professional, and dedicated to sharing their case with the people. Public records laws are often hailed for their potential to unveil wrongdoing. But using them to find rightdoing is just as interesting.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#ref1" id="fn1">1</a></sup> The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/opinion/nyt-opinion-oped-redesign.html">retired the term “op-ed”</a> about three months before Yost’s piece came out, replacing it with “guest essay.” (The Times called the term “a relic of an older age and an older print newspaper design” and an example of “clubby newspaper jargon.” Still, the move drew minor controversy, with some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/04/26/new-york-times-op-ed-announcement-opinion-newsletters-484751">accusing the paper of more sinister motives</a>.)
