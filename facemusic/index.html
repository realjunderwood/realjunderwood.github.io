<h2>We like to listen to music that matches our mood. But there's a problem with this: First, identifying how happy or sad you are requires a great deal of emotional intelligence. Second, even if you can do this, you can't possibly keep track of your msuci. </h2>
<h2>FaceMusic solves this by identifying how happy or sad you are from a picture of your face -- no emotional intelligence required. From there, FaceMusic identifies your favorite songs and makes a playlist of those songs that best match your mood.</h2>
