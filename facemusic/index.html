<h2>We like to listen to music that matches our mood. But there's a problem with this: First, identifying how happy or sad you are requires a great deal of emotional intelligence. Second, even if you can do this, you can't possibly keep track of your msuci. </h2>
<h2>FaceMusic solves this by identifying how happy or sad you are from a picture of your face -- no emotional intelligence required. From there, FaceMusic identifies your favorite songs and makes a playlist of those songs that best match your mood.</h2>

<p>Explain the tech very briefly</p>

<script src="spotify_auth.js"></script>
<script>
    function connect() {
        if (localStorage(""))
        generateCodeChallenge(64);

    }

    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    if (urlParams.get("code")) {
        let code = urlParams.get("code");
        let codeVerifier = localStorage.getItem('code_verifier');
        getToken(code);
        window.location.href();

    }



    if (urlParams.get("error")) {
        // say there was an error and remove url param
    }
    if (localStorage.getItem("access_token")) {
        console.log("YOOO there is an acecss token and it is " + localStorage.getItem("access_token"));
    }
